Now, we have two vectors in resembelence with the target vectors. Hence we are ready to analyze this randomly generated tree and extract its information. So, we simply call the analyzer function and give it the two decoded vectors - **analyzer(pVec ,dVec)**. As I said before, the analyzer returns the values and they are received in the appropriate in an assignment.

    "Using this function we want to check the success of each chromosome's metrics comparing them against the target's. First we make some lists and in the first line we make a grounding for our diagrams to be plotted on. The checklist is only a reference fro the plot and to check tDics against later to bring the vector to the required size for plotting (e.g. bringing (1,2,3) to the size of (1,2,3,4,5) would make it look like (1,2,3,0,0), hence we can plot each component versus the other and check the behaviour of the vector in general). \n",

    "For doing so, we need to make a loop and firstly check the availability of each component of the dic versus the target. If it existed in the target, we add it to the tDicList and if not, we add a zero to the tDicList. Then, it is time to process in reverse. We check if any component is left in the target vector and if anything was found we add a zero to the chromosome's vector and add the keys to the checkList and the values to the tDicList.\n",

Then we add a legend so we understand what each bar is showing and after that we add some labels and titles and stuff.\n",
