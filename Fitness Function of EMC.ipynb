The most important one for this part is the \"popDics\" list (list of dectionaries); it creates a dictionary with the counts of each event underlying each metric. Furthermore, \"fitSep\" is the fitness of each metric seperated for each chromosome of a population. In each iteration of the p loop (here for simplicity we set the limit to 1, but normally it should be equal to population size) each chromosome's fitness function is calculated for the vector of each metric. Each metric gives a fitness value and the average of all of them is added to \"fitness\" list."
